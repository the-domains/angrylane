The 1/4 Mile leather jacket is the first jacket we designed and made for us, by pure selfish need, for riding during the hot summer days. 

High grade of full grain cow leather from Korea, performance mesh for optimum breathability, Talon zippers from Japan, Gutermann German thread, you just can't get a better quality jacket for the price we sell them. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c6783722-fcdc-4cfe-8ef5-9ff4d6e834c4.jpg)

The different panels of leather are individually cut, and then holes are punched all over in the same pattern as the leather suits used by top MotoGP Riders.
