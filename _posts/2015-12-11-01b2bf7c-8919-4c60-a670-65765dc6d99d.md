If you don't need it, don't buy it.

Our world is all about consumption, all about getting things we don't need, all about the next season, the next trend, the next style. We are among those daring to say stop. This is madness.

We make limited quantities of classic wardrobe essentials. We use only the best leather and fabric available, the best hardware you can find today.

We work on every detail of the pattern and the construction. We became obsessed with details and this is the result of over 15 years of experience.

A leather jacket is the best investment you will ever make. A high quality leather jacket will last for decades, and if you take care of it, it will outlive you. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b1cd1d89-468b-41c3-8e92-b68542c4c105.jpg)
